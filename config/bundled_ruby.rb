# A release a Docker install updated itself to (Upgrade::InPlace) carries the Ruby it was built
# with in ruby/, beside its gems. The image's own Ruby starts the process (the entrypoint and the
# binstubs belong to whatever image is deployed), so before anything else loads, start again on
# the release's Ruby. It wasn't built for this path, so point it at its own libruby
# (LD_LIBRARY_PATH), standard library (RUBYLIB, ahead of the built-in /usr/local paths) and
# binaries (PATH); its
# rbconfig.rb then works out every other path, RubyGems' among them, from its own place on disk.
#
# Plain Ruby, no gems: required first by config/boot.rb and bin/thrust. A checkout or an image
# has no ruby/ beside the app, so it does nothing there.
